# Chandrayaan3_TDD_Assessment
To solve this assessment I used test driven development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code.
I simply used tdd rules to develop the solution
-No production code without failing test.
-Just enough test to cause code to fail.
-Just enough code to make test pass.

The solution revolves around three sessions red, green and refactor.

Before writing any code I wrote basic test case that is to initialize the x,y,z and direction.
The test case failed as I haven't written any code.
Then I wrote the code to just pass the test case.
Similarly the cycle continues.
